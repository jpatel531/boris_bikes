#Boris Bikes

A Week 3 Makers Academy project to create a simulation of a bike rental system. A person rents a bike from or drops a bike off to a docking station. A van picks up broken bikes from the docking station, and drops them off to the garage to get them fixed. When the bikes are fixed, the van picks the bikes from the garage and drops them off to the docking station.
